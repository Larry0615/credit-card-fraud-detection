#  Credit Card Fraud Detection (Python | 2025)

 **Project Overview**
This end-to-end project tackles the critical challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized real-world data. It showcases a complete machine learning workflow — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to class balancing (SMOTE), model evaluation, threshold tuning, and model serialization. This project simulates how a Data Analyst or Data Scientist would approach fraud risk in a real financial environment.

##  Business Questions

*  Can we accurately identify fraudulent transactions from historical patterns?
*  How do we handle highly imbalanced classes (only 0.17% are frauds)?
*  Which models perform best for this task (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)?
*  How can we maximize fraud detection without overwhelming false positives?
*  What threshold provides the best balance between Precision and Recall?

##  Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**

*  Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
*  284,807 total transactions
*  Only 492 are fraudulent (\~0.17%) — extreme class imbalance

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

*  Checked for nulls, datatypes, duplicates — all clean
*  Transaction `Amount` is right-skewed with most under €100
*  `Time` feature shows cyclical patterns — fraud occurs uniformly
*  Visualized class imbalance using count plots and log scales

### 3. **Data Preparation**

*  Scaled `Amount` feature using `StandardScaler`
*  Train-test split using `stratify=y` to preserve class distribution
*  Applied **SMOTE** to oversample minority (fraud) class in training data

### 4. **Modeling & Evaluation**

#### 🔹 Logistic Regression (Baseline)

*  Detected very few fraud cases (recall \~60%)
*  High precision but poor recall due to imbalance

#### 🔹 Logistic Regression + SMOTE

*  Significantly improved recall (88%)
*  Precision dropped — many false positives

#### 🔹 Random Forest Classifier + SMOTE

*  **Precision:** 78%
*  **Recall:** 89%
*  **F1 Score:** 83%
*  **ROC AUC:** 0.89
* ✅ Best model chosen for deployment

### 5. **Threshold Tuning**

*  Evaluated performance at multiple decision thresholds
*  Chose threshold that optimized F1 score
*  Final model caught 116 out of 148 frauds with 89% precision

### 6. **Model Export**

*  Saved model using `joblib.dump()` for deployment:

```python
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'random_forest_fraud_model.pkl')
```

##  Final Results

| Metric       | Score           |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Precision    | 0.89            |
| Recall       | 0.78            |
| F1 Score     | 0.83            |
| ROC AUC      | 0.89            |
| Fraud Caught | 116 / 148 (78%) |

##  Business Recommendations

*  Deploy model in real-time fraud monitoring systems
*  Re-tune threshold periodically to adjust to fraud trends
*  Retrain monthly using new transactions for freshness
*  Visualize fraud trends in Power BI or Tableau dashboards
