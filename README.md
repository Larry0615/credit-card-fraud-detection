# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection (Python | 2025)

📌 **Project Overview**  
This end-to-end project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data. It applies advanced feature engineering, data balancing techniques, and supervised machine learning models to classify rare fraud cases. The goal is to simulate how a Data Analyst or Data Scientist would approach fraud risk in a financial services context.

## 🔍 Business Questions

- 🕵️‍♂️ Can we accurately classify fraud using historical transaction patterns?
- 📉 How do we handle severe class imbalance in real-world fraud datasets?
- 🧠 Which machine learning models perform best in identifying fraud?
- 📊 What insights can we visualize to help risk analysts prioritize cases?

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Dataset: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - 284,807 transactions with only 492 fraud cases (~0.17%)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Class distribution, time-based behavior, amount trends
   - Correlation heatmaps and feature patterns

3. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   - Train-test split (stratified)
   - Handling imbalance with SMOTE and random undersampling

4. **Modeling & Evaluation**
   - Tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC
   - Confusion matrix and PR curves for business impact

5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Streamlit dashboard to demo fraud prediction on new data
